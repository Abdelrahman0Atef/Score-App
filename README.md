# Score App
**The Goal**<br/>
The goal of this app was to create a real-time score tracking app that displays live match updates and results, organized by league and team.

## What I Built
I built a modern score tracking app that provides users with up-to-the-minute match information, including live scores and final results, neatly presented in cards categorized by league.

## The Finished App
In the end, I successfully created a functional score tracking app that displays real-time match data, organized by league, with clear and concise cards for each match.
